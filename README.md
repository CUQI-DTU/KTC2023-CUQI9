## Description of the algorithm

We built a complete electrode model CEM by extending the model provided in [the linked BSc. thesis](https://findit.dtu.dk/en/catalog/56d754b8bf19455102000781). We also built the framework to solve a nonlinear optimization problem of inferring the conductivity $\sigma$ using a least-square optimization approach. We added three regularization terms. One is TV, based on [the linked tutorial](https://uvilla.github.io/cmis_labs/notebooks/ImageDenoising_TV.html). The second one is Tikhonov, based on the regularization class `SMPrior` provided by the competition. The third regularization term is a generalized Tikhonov regularization that penalizes more when close to the missing electrodes (and boundary). We used `scipy` L-BFGS-B to solve the optimization problem and segment with Chan-Vese segmentation method from `scikit-image`. Our implementation uses `FEniCS`, a finite element method library.



## Installation instructions
To run our EIT image reconstruction algorithm, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)
- Access to the provided dataset (not included in this repository)

Note that you will need to install `FEniCS 2019.1.0.` One way to do it is to follow Anaconda installation instructions in this [link](https://fenicsproject.org/download/archive/).
