## Description of the algorithm

We have used the provided code for the EIT image reconstruction with the following modifications:
- The Otsu segmentation algorithm has been replaced by the Chan-Vese segmentation algorithm from scikit-image.
- Additional generalized Tikhonov regularization has been added to penalize more when close to the missing electrodes (and boundary). The regularization matrix is a diagonal matrix. For example, for difficulty level 5, the diagonal elements mapped to image space look as in the image below:

## Installation instructions
To run our EIT image reconstruction algorithm, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)
- Access to the provided dataset (not included in this repository)

## Usage instructions
